# AntPattern

A Python simulation of ant-inspired pattern generation using agent-based logic and real-time visualization.  
Based on [Langton's ant turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).


---

## Overview

This project explores how simple rule-based agents (like ants) can produce complex patterns through local interactions and basic movement logic. It demonstrates how minimal logic can lead to beautiful, self-organized structures, inspired by swarm intelligence and decentralized systems in nature.

## Features

- Grid-based environment with customizable size and steps
- Multiple ant agents with independent behavior
- Trail decay and coloring for visual clarity
- Random or symmetric initialization
- Real-time animated visualization using `matplotlib`

## Technologies

- Python 3
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
